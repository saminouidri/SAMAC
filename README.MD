## What is SAMAC?
SAMAC, or SAP Automatic Material Creation, is an excel macro written in VBA, used to automate the creation of new materials on the ERP Management software, SAP. 
This was written as part of an internal initiative in my workplace, to facilitate and automate this process. 
## Usage & Features :

The basic idea is to take the basic data essential to material creation, which was already entered into an excel spreadsheet for the sake of keeping a record, and input it into SAP automatically, without having the user copy-pasting everything manually. This helps avoid potential human errors, and speeds up the process exponentially, especially when dealing with multiple materials. 


## Author(s)
The entire code was written by me (suroxdesigns) and some parts inspired by various resources online. The idea came from a nice colleague :)
